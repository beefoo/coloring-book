# THE PHILIPPINES, WARMING OCEANS, AND TYPHOONS

Typhoons are storms that occur in the western Pacific Ocean which form over large bodies of relatively warm water. The Philippines is made up of over 7,000 islands and is located in the western Pacific Ocean, surrounded by naturally warm waters. So the country has long been particularly vulnerable to extreme weather. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for typhoons to exist.

There is evidence that the intensity of typhoons have been increasing over the past few decades in the Philippines. Because of the complexity of storm systems and the many factors affecting their formation and strength, climate scientists have not reached consensus on the exact contribution climate change has had to an increase of storm intensity. However, the increased intensity of storms is consistent with the scientific consensus that the oceans are warming and that typhoons, hurricanes, and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea.

The consensus of climate scientists is increasingly that super storms will become more frequent. According to a recent special report by the Intergovernmental panel on climate change: "The average tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely to increase, but the global frequency of tropical cyclones is likely to decrease or remain unchanged."

The following page displays the ten deadliest typhoons of the Philippines in chronological order over the past 70 years since 1947. The circles represent those who are dead or missing as direct result of the storms. Five of the ten deadliest typhoons have occurred after 2006 over a period of just 7 years. The latest and deadliest storm on record in the Philippines is Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Typhoon Yolanda, had winds that reached nearly 200 miles per hour and killed 6,300 people with another 1,061 missing or presumed dead.
