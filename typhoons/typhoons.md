# THE PHILIPPINES, WARMING OCEANS, AND TYPHOONS

Typhoons are storms that occur in the western Pacific Ocean which form over large bodies of relatively warm water. Because of the complexity of storm systems and the many factors affecting their formation and strength, climate scientists have not yet reached consensus on climate change's direct contributions to typhoon activity. However, the consensus of climate scientists is increasingly that storms will become more intense as oceans warm. [1] This is because typhoons, hurricanes, and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea.

The Philippines is a collection of over 7,000 islands located in the western Pacific Ocean, surrounded by naturally warm waters, and is the most active place on Earth for typhoons to exist. If climate change has an effect on typhoon activity or intensity, the Philippines would likely feel the effects early and considerably. There is already evidence that the intensity of typhoons have been increasing over the past few decades in the Philippines.

The following page displays the ten deadliest typhoons of the Philippines in chronological order over the past 70 years since 1947. Five of the ten deadliest typhoons have occurred after 2006 over a period of just seven years, killing over 13,000 people and displacing millions. The size of each circle represents the number of dead or missing as a direct result of each storm. The latest and deadliest storm on record in the Philippines is Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Typhoon Yolanda, which had winds that reached nearly 200 miles per hour and killed 6,300 people with another 1,061 missing or presumed dead.
