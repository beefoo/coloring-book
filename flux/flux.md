# WHERE CARBON EMISSIONS ARE THE GREATEST

Human needs such as electricity, heating, and transportation often require the burning of fossil fuels in the United States. Since fossil fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, a map of carbon emissions looks very similar to a map of population density.

The map below uses data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and shows where fossil fuel emissions are the greatest in the United States [1]. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of global fossil fuel emissions but just over 4% of the world population. Use the table to the right to color each circle. The darkest areas on the map also correlate to where urban infrastructure and residential heating and electricity use is the greatest.

| Level  | Color   | 2015 carbon emissions (metric tons) |
|---     |---      |---                                  |
| 1      | White   | Under 1                             |
| 2      | Yellow  | 1 to 10                             |
| 3      | Orange  | 10 to 100                           |
| 4      | Red     | 100 to 500                          |
| 5      | Brown   | 500 to 1000                         |
| 6      | Black   | Over 1000                           |
