# CARBON EMISSIONS BY TRANSPORT TYPE

Consider a trip from Boston to New York, a 215 mile journey (190 miles by plane.) There would be no journey that is completely carbon-free if you use the "life-cycle" measurement of carbon emissions. Life-cycle carbon emissions considers the global-warming potential through the life-cycle of each energy source of the vehicle. For example, the energy exerted for biking 215 miles requires the burning of calories, therefore we must consider the production of food consumed, which includes agricultural activities, food processing, and transport of food.

In terms of per-passenger life-cycle carbon emissions, biking and walking are still the best way to get around, followed by public transportation. Taking a domestic flight rather than a bus, each passenger would be responsible for nine times as much carbon dioxide. A single driver in an SUV would be responsible for 16 times as much carbon dioxide as a passenger on a full bus.

The following page shows the approximate life-cycle carbon emissions of eight different forms of transportation from a trip from Boston to New York. [1] Color each cell, which represents one kilogram of life-cycle carbon emissions per passenger, according to the table below. The colors will highlight the differences each transport's carbon emissions.

| Label  | Color       |
|---     |---          |
| 1      | Light Green |
| 2      | Green       |
| 3      | Yellow      |
| 4      | Orange      |
| 5      | Red         |
| 6      | Purple      |
| 7      | Brown       |
| 8      | Black       |

The bus, train, and plane measurements assume that all seats are full. A carpool is measures with a driver and two passengers. All other modes of transportation are measured with a single driver.
