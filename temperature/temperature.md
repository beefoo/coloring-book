# THE HOTTEST MONTHS ON RECORD

Greenhouse gases (GHGs), or gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. GHGs warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which the energy escapes to space. They act like a blanket insulating the Earth. As human activities add more GHGs into the atmosphere, global land and ocean temperatures will warm.

There are 137 years of reliable scientific measurements of global land and ocean temperature on record. Out of those 137 years, the 20 hottest years happened in the last 22 years. The hottest 5 years have occurred in the last 7 years. The last 3 years all broke the record for being the hottest year on record.

What about the hottest January on record, or February, or March? The following page ranks the hottest of each month on record, which all occur after 1990. Color in the 1's as dark as possible, representing the hottest of that month on record. Color in the 2's a little lighter, representing the second hottest of that month on record, and so on until you reach the ninth hottest of that month on record.
