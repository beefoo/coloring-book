# Where the wind blows

Wind Power Density Class is a useful way to evaluate the wind resource available in a particular area. Areas with wind power density class 3 or greater are more suitable for utility-scale wind turbine applications. In the United States, wind power density is highest in the Great Plains where wind blows reliably across wide open spaces.

# Where the sun shines

Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) is useful way to measure the energy received from the sun on the surface of the Earth. Areas with a higher long-term average GHI are  more suitable for constructing utility-scale solar energy systems. In the United States, GHI is highest in the Southwest where the sun shines the most all year round.
