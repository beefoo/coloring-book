# LIGHTBULB CENSUS

Compared to traditional incandescent light bulbs, energy-efficient light bulbs such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) typically use about 75 to 80 percent less energy and can last 10 to 25 times longer. [1] For each incandescent light bulb switched to an energy-efficient one, there will be less carbon emissions and less money spent on energy and new light bulbs.

For each incandescent light bulb that you replace with an LED light bulb, you can save $18 per year. The carbon emission reductions of a single light bulb replacement is equivalent to planting one urban tree and letting it grow for ten years.

How much can your household save per year? Go around your home and color the following page according to the light bulbs you find. Once you found all the light bulbs, calculate your annual savings if you switch all light bulbs to LED light bulbs.
