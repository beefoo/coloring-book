This is not a coloring book for relaxation. The subject of climate change may evoke anxiety and urgency. This is not a book for quick facts about climate change. The act of coloring is slow. Although information about climate change is ultimately conveyed, this coloring book is better suited to facilitate a reflection on the underlying issues relating to climate change. Lastly, this book was made using climate data and research from authoritative sources, but don't trust this book by itself. Ask questions, research the issues, check the sources, and verify the results. Take the appropriate actions.
