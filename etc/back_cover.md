This is not a coloring book for relaxation or a book for creating beautiful images (though it is a possible result.) This book delivers information about climate change through data, scientific research, and the act of coloring. Because coloring is slow, you are encouraged to reflect upon the underlying issues relating to climate change. Trace what Arctic sea ice looked like 20 years ago and color what was lost since then. See if you can color faster than forests are being destroyed. Color a year of air pollution in Beijing. Color the shape of what New York City might look like if global temperatures continue to rise.
