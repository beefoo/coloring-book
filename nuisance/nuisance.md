# RISING TIDES AND COASTAL FLOODING

Sea level rise around the globe is not uniform. Ocean currents and wind patterns cause water build ups in some areas, ocean temperatures vary and higher temperature areas have higher levels because water expands as it warms, and the weight of ice sheets affect the Earth's axis of rotation and the water distribution.

The United States' East and Gulf coasts are particularly prone to the effects of sea level rise. Such effects are already being observed through flooding caused by nothing more than high tides, also known as "sunny day" flooding, forcing cities to spend millions repairing roads, drains, and homes, and investing in raised streets, sea walls, and pumps.

The following page shows three coastal cities that have seen a sharp jump in tidal flooding in recent years. To illustrate the relationship between sea level rise [1] and tidal flooding [2], color the bars according to the table below. Darker colors represent more days of tidal flooding.

| Label  | Color   | Days of tidal flooding  |
|---     |---      |---                      |
| W      | White   | 5 or less               |
| Y      | Yellow  | 6 to 10                 |
| O      | Orange  | 11 to 20                |
| R      | Red     | 21 to 40                |
| M      | Maroon  | 41 to 60                |
| B      | Brown   | Over 60                 |
