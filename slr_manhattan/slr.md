# SEA LEVEL SCENARIOS

Even if we stop burning fossil fuels today, temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise for hundreds of years because carbon pollution persists in the atmosphere for a long period of time. This means that certain levels of global carbon emissions can "lock in" certain sea levels in the future.

Global warming of 2 °C (3.6 °F) is a long-standing international target, and corresponds to what many would consider successful global efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. It also corresponds to 4.7 meters (15.4 feet) of global sea level rise to take place somewhere between centuries and millennia from now depending on how quickly global ice sheets melt. A warming of 4 °C (7.2 °F) is closer to our current path where current emissions rates continue, and corresponds to 8.9 m (29.2 ft) of locked-in global sea level rise. [1]

The maps of Manhattan on the following page do not show what the island would look like this century due to sea level rise. They show scientific projections of what post-2100 Manhattan will look like depending on which path we take for reducing or escalating carbon emissions. The 2 °C scenario assumes that humans worldwide will make more sustainable development choices by using more efficient technologies, such as wind and solar, for producing energy. The 4 °C scenario assumes humans will continue to accelerate the rate at which we emit carbon dioxide, which is consistent with a global economy that continues to rely mainly on fossil fuels. [2]

Color the island green and the water blue. In the two scenarios, the areas in blue are permanently underwater, including most of lower Manhattan, East Harlem, and Inwood. Other major coastal cities around the country and the world such as Miami, New Orleans, Boston, Mumbai, and Shanghai will experience similar transformations.
