# RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL

According to the United States Department of Energy, the U.S. consumed over 97 Quadrillion BTUs of energy in 2015 [1], equivalent to the amount of energy consumed by 1.5 billion cars driven for one year. [2] However, only about 10 percent of the country's energy needs was supplied through renewable energy which includes hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass. The majority of the energy consumed in the U.S. comes from fossil fuels.

The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated the country's potential energy production of renewable energy technologies. These estimates take into consideration resource availability, physical potential of resources, available technology, land limitations, and land-use constraints, but does not consider economic or market factors. With that into account, renewable energy sources can potentially provide over 14 times the energy we currently consume. The state of Texas alone could generate the whole country's energy needs with just solar power technology. [3]
