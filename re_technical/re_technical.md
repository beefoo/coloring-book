# RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country consumed over 97 Quadrillion BTUs of energy in 2015 [1], equivalent to about 1.5 billion cars driven for one year. [2] However only about 10 percent of the energy we consume is supplied through renewable energy which includes hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass. The majority of the energy we consume comes from fossil fuels and nuclear electric power.

The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated the potential of renewable energy technologies. These estimates take into consideration resource availability, physical potential of resources, technology performance, topographic limitations, and land-use constraints. With those considerations taken into account, renewable energy can potentially provide nearly four times the energy we currently consume. [3]
