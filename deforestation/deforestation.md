# GLOBAL DEFORESTATION

Growing forests accumulate and store carbon. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it for a long period of time. Therefore, forests are vital for mitigating the effects of climate change on the environment.

The clearing of forests and the fires that accompany it generate one-tenth of all global warming emissions. [1] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the world had 4,128 million hectares of forest in 1990. By 2015 this area had decreased to 3,999 million hectares of forest, a net loss of 129 million hectares of global forest over a 25 year period. [2]

This is equivalent to losing 20 football fields worth of forest every minute for 25 years. In the Brazilian Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, deforestation rose in 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade, to nearly two million acres. [3]

How fast can you color 20 football fields? Take out a stopwatch or timer and set it to one minute. See if you can color the 20 football fields on the right faster than we have been losing global forests.
