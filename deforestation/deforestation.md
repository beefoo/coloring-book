# GLOBAL DEFORESTATION

Growing forests accumulate and store carbon. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it for a long period of time. Therefore, forests are vital for mitigating the effects of climate change on the environment.

In 1990 the world had 4,128 million hectares of forest. By 2015 this area had decreased to 3,999 million hectares of forest. This figure represents net forest loss over a 25 year period and therefore accounts for forest expansion in some areas of the world. This means that there was a net loss of 129 million hectares of global forest over a 25 year period. This is equivalent to losing 20 football fields worth of forest every minute for 25 years.

How fast can you color 20 football fields? Take out a stopwatch or timer and set it to one minute. See if you can color the 20 football fields on the right faster than we are losing global forests.
