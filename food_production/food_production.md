# GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION

Rice, corn (maize), and wheat are the staple crops that supply 60 percent of the world's food energy intake. Corn is the most produced and consumed crop by weight, with uses ranging from food, animal feed, and ethanol. [1] The United States is the world's largest corn grower, producing more than 40 percent of the world's corn.

However, severe droughts, floods and heat waves at key moments in the growing season are becoming increasingly common, causing dramatic year-to-year supply shocks. Corn is uniquely sensitive to the effects of climate change, including hotter temperatures and water stress. Corn is also a thirsty plant, and about 20 percent of corn production is in irrigated areas. Most of those areas, about 87 percent, are undergoing water shortages. [2]

The following page shows projections of global corn production where current carbon emissions continue at their current rate. [3] To contrast, the United Nation's median projected global populations are also shown. [4] Although food production has been able to keep pace with population growth on the global scale, periodically there are serious regional deficits, and nutritional deficiencies affect close to a billion people globally. In this century climate change is one factor that could affect food production and availability in many parts of the world, particularly those most prone to drought and famine.
