# SHRINKING ARCTIC SEA ICE

Sea ice is simply frozen ocean water. Part of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice year-round. Even though sea ice occurs primarily in the polar regions, it influences our global climate. Sea ice has a bright surface, so much of the sunlight that strikes it is reflected back into space, keeping polar regions relatively cool. If gradually warming temperatures melt sea ice over time, fewer bright surfaces are available to reflect sunlight back into space, more solar energy is absorbed at the surface, and temperatures rise further. This chain of events starts a cycle of warming and melting.

The area covered by sea ice is typically smallest in September, after the summer melting season. Sea ice can be dramatically altered by climate change since ice can easily change between solid and liquid states in response to relatively minor changes in temperature. September Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average.

On the following page, the solid line shows the Arctic sea ice extent (or area with at least 15% ice concentration) in September 2016. The dotted line shows the Arctic sea ice extent in September 1996, 20 years earlier. [1] Color in the area between these two lines. This area represents a difference of 3.15 million square kilometers of sea ice [2], or about the size of India.
