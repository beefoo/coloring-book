# Air pollution in Beijing

When carbon-based fuels are burned, carbon dioxide and other pollutants are released into the atmosphere. Pollutants include particulate matter (PM) which can heat the Earth's climate by absorbing radiation of the sun. When inhaled, these pollutants can also have serious negative effects on human health.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standard for reporting daily air quality [1]. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The reporting includes ground-level ozone and particulate matter which are the two pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human health. The AQI is divided into the following categories:

| Level  | Color   | Air quality                    |
|---     |---      |---                             |
| 1      | Green   | Good                           |
| 2      | Yellow  | Moderate                       |
| 3      | Orange  | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups |
| 4      | Red     | Unhealthy                      |
| 5      | Purple  | Very Unhealthy                 |
| 6      | Brown   | Hazardous                      |
| 7      | Black   | Beyond Index                   |

On the right, there are 365 circles to represent each day in 2015 for Beijing, a city with a population of over 21 million people. Each day is labelled with the AQI level for that day [2]. Fill in each day with the color associated with that level. Note that some days have a level of 7, which represents measurements that exceed the most hazardous values supported by the index.
