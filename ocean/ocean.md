# WARMING AND RISING SEAS

Global sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades to about one-eighth of an inch per year. The two major causes of global sea level rise are thermal expansion caused by warming of the ocean (since water expands as it warms) and increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The oceans are absorbing more than 90 percent of the increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity. [1]

Higher sea levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges push farther inland than they once did. Marine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Warming sea surface temperatures increase the risks of coral bleaching, which can lead to coral death and the loss of critical habitat for marine species. Warmer oceans hold less oxygen, and the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the absorption of carbon dioxide in the ocean, which subsequently makes the oceans more acidic and makes survival harder for marine life.

The following page will illustrate the relationship between ocean warming [2] and sea level rise [3] that occurred over 20 years from 1995 to 2015. Each horizontal line represents the change in mean sea level from 1995. Color the areas beneath each line according to the table below, which will show the change in ocean temperature relative to the 20th century average for each month of that year.

| Blue (B) | Green (G) | Yellow (Y) | Orange (O) | Red (R) | Violet (V) |
| 0     -------->    +0.5     -------->    +1     -------->     +1.5    |
|      Change from 20th century average temperature (Â° Fahrenheit)      |
