# Coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef

Coral reefs hold some of the richest and most diverse life in the world's oceans. They also supply hundreds of millions of people with food and generate billions of dollars in income through tourism each year. Corals thrive in warm waters, but are very sensitive to extra heat which causes them to expel the algae living inside them, turning completely white. This is called coral bleaching. If corals are bleached too frequently without time to recover, they are prone to death by starvation or disease.

The Great Barrier Reef, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs. Warming oceans caused by climate change have contributed to three global mass bleaching events since 1998. The latest in 2016 is the longest and worst global coral bleaching event in history. Scientists have confirmed the largest die-off of corals ever recorded on Australiaâ€™s Great Barrier Reef.[1]

Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority surveyed 873 individual reefs.[2] Color the following page according to the table below which illustrates their findings.

| 0      | Green   | No bleaching        |
| 1      | Yellow  | Minor bleaching     |
| 2      | Orange  | Moderate bleaching  |
| 3      | Red     | Severe bleaching    |
