# GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS

Since 1751, about the start of the Industrial Revolution, approximately 392 billion metric tons of carbon have been released to the atmosphere from the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Half of these fossil-fuel carbon emissions have occurred since the mid 1980s. The 2013 global fossil-fuel carbon emission estimate, 9.9 billion metric tons of carbon, represents an all-time high and a 1.1% increase over 2012 emissions [1]. In total, humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. [2]

The following three pages compare the carbon emissions from fossil fuels in the years 1800, 1900, and 2013, the latest measured year from the U.S. Department of Energy. With one dot representing one million metric tons of carbon emissions, see how many dots you can color in for each year.
